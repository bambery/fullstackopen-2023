# Full Stack Open 2023

I began this course last year, and since then several updates have been made. I also did not originally submit my material to the University of Helsinki, intending to complete the studies on my own.

I have decided to start from the beginning and submit my assignments for credit. I also have a list of issues with course content and wording that I assembled my first pass through, and will be submitting PRs to the repo if I find these issues persist.
